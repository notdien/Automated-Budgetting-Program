# Automated-Budgetting-Program
# A program for me to auto budget my own money.
My schedule started getting more packed so I decided instead of writing and calculating my incoming paychecks, I would make a program to do it all for me.
The program is writing and saving to a file system to keep track of the money coming in and out.
All the data on the file is the program in used by me, everything there is real and actual incoming money or outgoing money.
As of now, the program is taliored to me, but I have plans to create more with it.
